# obee
A text editor for the practical man. Designed to be easier to use than Notepad, but with code more complicated than anything you've seen before.

## Installation
Clone this repo, then compile using gcc.

$ gcc km.c -o obee

or if on Windows:

$ clang km.c -S -emit-llvm -o - -O3


Run with

./obee

## TODO
- ~~making it sub-350 lines~~
- ~~making it bitchin' fast~~
- ~~making it usable on windows~~

Made with love for use of my fellow /bant/ users.
